A script to upload your shotwell photos to trovebox (formerly openphoto).

## Plan

* List photos from Shotwell database
  * http://redmine.yorba.org/projects/shotwell/wiki/ShotwellArchDatabase
* Push over the Trovebox API
  * https://trovebox.com/documentation
  * https://github.com/photo/openphoto-python/blob/master/setup.py
* Record what we have done so we can repeat or do this incrementally
